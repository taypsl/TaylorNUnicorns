<p>Once upon a time, a girl named Taylor traveled to a Far Away Place. &nbsp;It was only supposed to be a short visit.</p>

	<div class="page">
		<div class="img"><img src="images/p2.png">
		</div>
	</div>

<p>At first glance, it seemed like the Far Away Place was kind of Boring. &nbsp;But on the inside, the people she met were very Not Boring.</p>

	<div class="page">
		<div class="img"><img src="images/p3.png">
		</div>
	</div>

<p>After a little time had passed, Taylor started to notice something a bit different about two people in particular.</p>

	<div class="page">
		<div class="img"><img src="images/p4.png">
		</div>
	</div>

<p>It seemed like Evan and Chienlan were...</p>
<p>Unicorns!</p>

	<div class="page">
		<div class="img"><img src="images/p5.png">
		</div>
	</div>

<p>Just as Taylor decided to stay in the Far Away Place a little longer with Unicorn Evan and Unicorn Chienlan, a new person arrived.</p>

	<div class="page">
		<div class="img"><img src="images/p6.png">
		</div>
	</div>

<p>Pretty soon, Taylor began to notice something different about this new friend, too...</p>
<p>She was also a unicorn!</p>

	<div class="page">
		<div class="img"><img src="images/p7.png">
		</div>
	</div>

<p>Taylor loved making magical things with the team of friendly unicorns.</p>

	<div class="page">
		<div class="img"><img src="images/p8.png">
		</div>
	</div>

<p>It was so much fun that everyone agreed they should invite more people to help them make more magical things.</p>
<p>That's when Allison sailed by!</p>

	<div class="page">
		<div class="img"><img src="images/p9.png">
		</div>
	</div>

<p>And after only a little time in the Far Away Place, it was obvious to everyone...</p>
<p>That Allison, too, was a unicorn!</p>

	<div class="page">
		<div class="img"><img src="images/p10.png">
		</div>
	</div>

<p>Then Elaine came to stay!</p>

<div class="page">
		<div class="img"><img src="images/p11.png">
		</div>
	</div>

<p> At first, she didn't look like a unicorn. &nbsp;But everyone knows unicorns are hard to disguise, especially if you know how to look for one.</p>
<p>And sure enough...</p>
<p>Unicorn!</p>

	<div class="page">
		<div class="img"><img src="images/p12.png">
		</div>
	</div>

<p>The team of unicorns worked hard to make wonderfully magical things, and Taylor loved every minute they spent together. &nbsp;It truly was both Good and Great.</p>

	<div class="page">
		<div class="img"><img src="images/p13.png">
		</div>
	</div>

<p>But too, too soon the day became very late in the Far Away Place. &nbsp;Taylor knew the time was coming when she'd have to go home and leave her friendly unicorns for a while.</p>

	<div class="page">
		<div class="img"><img src="images/p14.png">
		</div>
	</div>

<p>And she knew she would miss them a lot.</p>

	<div class="page">
		<div class="img"><img src="images/p15.png">
		</div>
	</div>

<p>But as Taylor started out on her long journey home, she noticed something had changed...</p>

	<div class="page">
		<div class="img"><img src="images/p16.png">
		</div>
	</div>

<p>... and she was very grateful for her unicorn friends.</p>
<p>The End</p>
<p>(But not really...)</p>
